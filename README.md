When it comes to audio files there doesn’t seem to be an accepted standard in regards to using metadata and file naming. 
As someone who has built up a large collection of digital music I found that every album and/or source would throw in metadata information such as author, album name, track name, etc. at random into the file name. 
This would make organizing collections and finding specific files a nightmare.
Rather than renaming each file individually I built a small script that can be launched from a shell or terminal such as command prompt. The script accepts a folder location, loops through all the files in the folder and renames the files to match the file’s title metadata.
